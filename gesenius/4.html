<div style="text-align: center" id="GHGpar4-heading"><big>&#167;4.&#160;<i>Division and Arrangement of the Grammar</i>.</big></div>
<p>The division and arrangement of Hebrew grammar follow the three constituent parts of every language, viz. (1) articulate <i>sounds</i> represented by <i>letters</i>, and united to form <i>syllables</i>, (2) <i>words</i>, and (3) <i>sentences</i>.</p>
<p>The first part (the elements) comprises accordingly the treatment of <i>sounds</i> and their representation in writing. It describes the nature and relations of the sounds of the language, teaches the pronunciation of the written signs (orthoepy), and the established mode of writing (orthography). It then treats of the sounds as combined in syllables and words, and specifies the laws and conditions under which this combination takes place.</p>
<p>The second part (etymology) treats of words in their character as parts of speech, and comprises: (1) the principles of the <i>formation of words</i>, or of the derivation of the different parts of speech from the roots or from one another; (2) the principles of <i>inflexion</i>, i.e. of the various forms which the words assume according to their relation to other words and to the sentence.</p>
<p>The third part (syntax, or the arrangement of words): (1) shows how the word-formations and inflexions occurring in the language are used to express different shades of ideas, and how other ideas, for which the language has not coined any forms, are expressed by periphrasis; (2) states the laws according to which the parts of speech are combined in sentences (the principles of the sentence, or syntax in the stricter sense of the term).</p>
